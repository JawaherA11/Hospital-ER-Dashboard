# Hospital-ER-Dashboard
# Final Dashboard of Hospital Emergency Room  

This project is my first data analysis work in Excel as a fresh graduate. The goal was to design a **Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard** that provides stakeholders with clear insights to improve efficiency, monitor patient flow, and support data-driven decision-making.  

## Key Insights Covered in the Dashboard  
- Total Number of Patients (daily ER visits)  
- Average Wait Time to See a Patient  
- Patient Admission Status (Admitted vs. Not Admitted)  
- Patient Age Distribution by groups  
- Gender Analysis (Male vs. Female)  
- Department Referrals (most referred departments)  
- Percentage of Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes (Timeliness)  

## Tools and Techniques Used  
- **Power Query:** Extracted and transformed raw data  
- **Power Pivot:** Built relationships and applied DAX formulas  
- **Pivot Tables:** Generated summaries and reports  
- **Data Visualization:** Designed an interactive dashboard to present insights  

This dashboard highlights how **data analysis and visualization** can be applied in healthcare to optimize emergency room operations, improve patient management, and enhance overall hospital performance.
